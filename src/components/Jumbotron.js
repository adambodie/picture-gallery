		<h1>Picture Gallery</h1>
		<p>For Four Years, I created a photo gallery of pictures I took which I featured on my front page as "Picture of the Week."  It was a fun project that kept me looking at my portfolio site.  But reaching the Four Year mark, I felt it was necessary to pull the plug and make my portfolio site focused solely on my projects.  With that, I moved the photo gallery to its own page.  Here are the photos from my Picture of the Week gallery.</p>
