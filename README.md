Picture Gallery
===================

## Technologies used
* React
* Next
* Sass

I initially kept a picture gallery I updated weekly on my portfolio site [Bodie Web Design](http://bodiewebdesign.com), but after four years, I instead felt it would be best to move it to its own page.  In building this project, I also used the Next framework for server side rendering.  This provided me with a different set of tools of creating blog styled projects, now being able to build with server side rendering.
